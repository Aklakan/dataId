DBpedia DataID
======

The DBpedia DataID Unit is a DBpedia group with the goal of describing LOD datasets via RDF files, to host and deliver these metadata files together with the dataset in a uniform way, create and validate such files and deploy the results for the DBpedia and its local chapters. Established vocabularies like [DCAT](http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/), [VoID](http://vocab.deri.ie/void), [Prov-O](http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/) and [SPARQL Service Description](http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-service-description/) are to be reused for maximum compatibility. This way, we hope to establish a uniform and accepted way to describe and deliver dataset metadata for arbitrary LOD datasets and to put existing standards into practice.
